# thebluelist

I bought up mybluelist.org and will be posting the site as soon as I have the scaffolding in place.  It’s an open source project that offers 4 main things:

1. Businesses / shopping reference.
    - This section will allow users to ensure their money doesn't go to companies that fund authoritarian regimes.
    - Search by a business name or a category (groceries). It tells you the donation % over the past 2 years that went to R or D, and if they donated to Trump directly, the Save America PAC directly, or the America PAC directly. It then recommends alternatives companies that operate in the same space.
    - Additionally, searches can be limited by inputting a zip code or city / town name and a radius to find options close to where you are / will be.  Location data must never be requested or stored / harvested by this app.

2. Safety at Home reference.
    - This section helps users stay safe at home by providing plans and references. Given the damage Trump did to our institutions last time and the assumed appointment of RFK to oversee the FDA and CDC, this will be a list of things you can do at home to ensure you have access to clean food, water, that you’re vaccinated ahead of time, etc.
    - A general checklist can be downloaded.
    - Users can fill in a questionnaire that asks about number of people, number of pets, amount of indoor space, access to private outdoor space, amount of private outdoor space, climate or zip code, allergies. Then it generates a recommended plan to ensure access to safe food, safe water, and medical care.

3. Safety Online reference.  
    - This one is just a checklist of things that you should do ahead of this new regime. He already tore down net neutrality last time and Project 2025 is terrible. At the very least, people need E2E encrypted communication instead of standard messages, secure browsers instead of Chrome / Safari / Firefox / Edge, VPN and TOR setup instructions, etc.

4. Relocation reference. 
    - This one will have a list of countries that are friendly to US expats and a checklist to help people choose and relocate. 
    - An initial safety checklist will include items such as "ensure all family members have passports", "ensure all pets have vaccination records", "ensure all passports are valid for at least 3 years", etc.
    - Users can fill out a questionnare including number of family members, number of pets, professional fields by family member, nationality -2 generations, etc. It will then make recommendations in order of best fit based on your answers. For each, it will output a guide to applying for a visa, a preparation checklist, a cost of living guide, a recommendation on finding work for that country, and an estimated budget.

The project will be open-source to ensure no single entity can fully shut it down. I'm looking at hosting outside the US once it's online.  To start it's in Github and going into GCP. I recommend that everyone clone this repo and keep it up to date so you have a local copy should it vanish.
